This repo has most of the code that I wrote over the summer research

Structure and content of each folder:

1. Arduino 
    * BasicMotorControl - basic control of the dc motor using the l298 controller.
2. Kinematics
    * Jacobian - provides an example of jacobian matrix unilization for robot arm kinematics.
    * KinematicsTut - introduction to basic kinematics and linear algebra basics. Check https://github.com/kir486680/Robotics-Tutorial for most recent code 
3. Mindstorm 
4. Processing
    * MotorControl - controls the motor with GUI using the serial communications. 
    * RobotSimulator - simulation of the Lego Robot.
5. ROS
    * Basics - has examples of cretion of basic pub/sub systems.
